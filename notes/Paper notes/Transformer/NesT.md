### Block Aggregation for Mixing information accross blocks
local attention improved data efficiency

**non-local communication** is important to maintain translational invariance

* process information in their block
* mix global information during block aggregation with spatial operation(e.g. conv / pooling)


other local attention:
* [Halonet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12731)
* Swin Transformer
